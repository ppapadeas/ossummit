				Today we are going to take a view on what motivates people to contribute to open source, and we will be doing that 
				by examining volunteerism and its relation with open source. Mozilla's experience for over 15 years in community
				building can help us articulate those motivations, and it is the source of most of today's points.

		<footer class="notes">
			Now let's talk about volunteerism. In their basic nature, open source contributions are a form of volunteerism. As such
			they inherit the inner workings of a volunteer contribution system together with their set motivations for participation.
			There is extensive literature for volunteerism, nethertheless we should cover the basics behind incentivization of volunteers.

		<footer class="notes">
			One of the basic incentives that drive volunteers can be altruism. The sense of selflessness and the urge to help others, most of the time inspired by the mission of the project, is definitely a strong motivation, and one that most volunteer projects are trying to build up most.

		<footer class="notes">
			The sense of belonging in a group, making new friends and having fun can be also a strong motivation for volunteers. In general do not underestimate the power of socializing especially among volunteer groups.

		<footer class="notes">
			Learning and development can be another key theme on defining motivations for volunteer projects. Learning and polishing
			new skills, gaining work experience, receiving professional training and even developing leadership abilities are things
			that contributors might be looking into when joining a project.

		<footer class="notes">
			A final point on volunteering motivations is rewards and recognition. Non-monetary rewards and public recognition 
			through communication channels owned by the project can	act as a token of appriciation from the project to the
			contributor. A special mention about swag in specific : Many would disregard them as incentivization mechanism, 
			but I can assure you that they can play a key role early on engaging with the contributor.
			So up until now, we covered the basic set of motivations for volunteerism, but what happens with Open Source projects?

			Most open source projects are cultivated out in the public with participation from all over the world. Their nature 
			enables it. It is virtual, open to everyone and largely anonymous. A pregraduate student from Mombai can join a 
			freelance programmer from Santiago de Chile to contribute to your projects. It is this celebration of diversity and 
			global thinking that drives many people to participate in open source projects.

			Due to the nature of many open source projects, detailed and otherwise not available documentation, specifications and data, needs to be accessible to the prospective contributors. This access to data intrugues many of them and can act as a great motivation.

		<footer class="notes">
			When an open source project is deployed as participatory throughout its structure, the participatory governance poses a

		<footer class="notes">
			Open source projects have many times highly specifc and exclusive requirements in terms of technical skills from their 
			contributors. Sometimes even us, as community builders have trouble identifying them and articulating them. It is this
			exclusivity and uniqueness that intrigues many contributors to join and be creative with like-minded people.
